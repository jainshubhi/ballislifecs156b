# CS 156b: The Netflix Challenge
Our team, Ball is Life:

- Shubhi Jain

## Our Strategy
A blending of timeSVD++, RBM, and KNN.

## Usage
Compile everything with:
make all

Compute averages (only needs to be done once):
./bin/averages

Run timeSVD++:
./bin/svd

Run KNN:

./bin/knn

Run RBM:

./bin/rbm

Finally, run Blender:

./bin/blender

And check output file.

Alternatively, run:

./run.sh

And it will do all of the above.
